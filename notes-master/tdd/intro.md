# Intro to TDD

## Objectives

* Understand the philosophy and the *why* of testing
* Solve a test driven problem on codewars
* Set up your local test environment

## Codewars exercise warmup

[2 + 2 * 2 Problem](http://www.codewars.com/kata/2-plus-2-star-2-problem)

## Why test?

### Philosophy

#### The Big Dealâ„¢ - Think about what you'll do, before you do it

* :pencil: Write a test to describe and specify the code you'll write
* :broken_heart: Have the test fail
* :green_heart: Write the *minimum* amount of code to pass the test
* :repeat: Refactor your code

#### Side effects

* Maintainable code
* Confidence in your own code/others' confidence in your code
* Less "jiggling until it works"

#### Travis CI and automated builds

* [Travis Underscore Builds](https://travis-ci.org/jashkenas/underscore/)
* [Live Builds Running *NOW*](https://travis-ci.org/)

## Local environment set up

### Environment check

Can everyone run these commands successfully?

```
$ npm -v
```

```
$ node -v
```

### Let's run through the steps for running tests (simple sample example)
