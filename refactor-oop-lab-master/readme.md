## Refactor OOP Lab 

In this lab you will refactor our solution to the [previous weekend's
lab](https://github.com/wdi-sf-jan/squad_lab).


Use the work we had done in class together refactoring the Squad code into its own model class as inspiration for refactoring all the Student related code into its own model class.

We will introduce some more advanced concepts as you work through the lab during the afternoon.
